# Verbose Prompt Format

The verbose prompt is the bridge between the knowledge tree and working Manim code. A well-structured verbose prompt produces dramatically better animations than vague descriptions.

## Why Verbose Prompts Work

1. **LaTeX forces precision**: Exact mathematical notation leaves no ambiguity
2. **Detailed cinematography**: Specific colors, positions, and timings guide code generation
3. **Sequential structure**: Clear scene ordering produces organized code
4. **Complete specifications**: Nothing left to guess or infer

## Complete Template

# Manim Animation: {TARGET_CONCEPT}

## Overview
This animation builds {TARGET_CONCEPT} from first principles through a carefully
constructed knowledge tree. Each concept is explained with mathematical rigor
and visual clarity, building from foundational ideas to advanced understanding.

**Total Concepts**: {CONCEPT_COUNT}
**Progression**: {CONCEPT_1} -> {CONCEPT_2} -> ... -> {TARGET_CONCEPT}
**Estimated Duration**: {TOTAL_SECONDS} seconds ({MINUTES}:{SECONDS:02d})

## Animation Requirements
- Use Manim Community Edition (manim)
- All LaTeX must be in raw strings: r"$\\frac{a}{b}$"
- Use MathTex() for equations, Text() for labels
- Maintain color consistency throughout
- Ensure smooth transitions between scenes
- Include voiceover-friendly pacing (2-3 seconds per concept introduction)

## Scene Sequence

### Scene 1: {CONCEPT_1}
**Timestamp**: 0:00 - 0:15

Begin by fading in the coordinate axes using FadeIn(axes) with WHITE color.
Position the axes at ORIGIN. Next, display the foundational equation
r"$y = mx + b$" using MathTex() in BLUE color, positioning it at the TOP
of the screen using .to_edge(UP).

Create the equation using Write(equation) animation over 2 seconds. Then,
draw a sample line using Create(line) in YELLOW color, showing a concrete
example of y = 2x + 1. Label the line with Text("slope = 2") in GREEN,
positioned to the RIGHT of the line.

Wait 1 second, then fade all elements to prepare for the next concept using
FadeOut(Group(axes, equation, line, label)).

---

### Scene N: {TARGET_CONCEPT}
**Timestamp**: {START} - {END}

This is the culminating scene. Transform the previous elements to show how
all concepts connect to {TARGET_CONCEPT}. Display the key equation
r"${MAIN_EQUATION}$" prominently in the center using MathTex() with GOLD color.

Highlight the connection to prerequisites by using Indicate() on relevant
terms. Add a final summary text explaining the core insight.
```

## Scene Segment Structure

Each scene segment should include:

### 1. Timestamp Header
```markdown
### Scene 3: Schrodinger Equation
**Timestamp**: 0:30 - 0:45
```

### 2. Opening Action
Start with a verb describing the first animation:
- "Begin by fading in..."
- "Start with the transformation of..."
- "Open by displaying..."

### 3. Equation Display
Include exact LaTeX with positioning:
```
Display the equation r"$i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi = \hat{H}\Psi$"
using MathTex() in BLUE color, centered at ORIGIN.
```

### 4. Visual Elements
Specify all objects with:
- Manim class: `MathTex()`, `Text()`, `Axes()`, `Circle()`
- Color: `BLUE`, `RED`, `YELLOW`, etc.
- Position: `ORIGIN`, `UP`, `LEFT`, `.to_edge()`, `.next_to()`

### 5. Animation Sequence
List animations in order:
```
1. FadeIn(axes) over 1 second
2. Write(equation) over 2 seconds
3. Create(graph) following the equation curve
4. Indicate(key_term) with YELLOW highlight
5. Wait 1 second
6. FadeOut(Group(all_elements))
```

### 6. Transition Hook
End with setup for next scene:
```
The equation remains on screen, shifted to the upper left,
as we introduce the next concept.
```

## Color Palette Guidelines

Maintain consistency across scenes:

| Element Type | Recommended Color |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Primary equations | BLUE |
| Secondary equations | YELLOW |
| Axes/grids | WHITE or GREY |
| Graphs/curves | YELLOW, GREEN |
| Labels | GREEN |
| Highlights | GOLD or ORANGE |
| Warnings/errors | RED |
| Success/completion | GREEN |

## Timing Guidelines

| Content Type | Duration |
|--------------|----------|
| Simple equation display | 2-3 seconds |
| Complex equation with explanation | 4-5 seconds |
| Graph/visualization creation | 3-4 seconds |
| Transition between concepts | 1-2 seconds |
| Pause for comprehension | 1 second |
| Complete scene | 15-30 seconds |

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Vague descriptions**: "Show the equation" -> "Display r'$E=mc^2$' using MathTex() in BLUE at TOP"
2. **Missing positions**: Always specify where elements appear
3. **Unclear timing**: Include duration for each animation
4. **No transitions**: Explicitly describe how scenes connect
5. **Inconsistent colors**: Define palette and stick to it
6. **Missing LaTeX escaping**: Use raw strings with double backslashes
